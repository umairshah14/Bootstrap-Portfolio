# My-portfolio-page

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week 3 challenge which was to create a Bootstrap Portfolio Page to showcase projects that i've done to potential employers

This task helped me further solidify my understandings and knowledge of boostrap elements and components such as cards, kitchen sinks and jumbotrons. In my page i used boostrap html elements to create my portfolio.

Below is a screenshot of what the project looks like
